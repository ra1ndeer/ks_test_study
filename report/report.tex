\title{An in-depth experimental study on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test}
\date{August, 2019}
\author{Lu√≠s Franco}

\begin{document}

	\maketitle

	\begin{abstract}

		Sample abstract with a lot of text showcasing how good/cool the results obtained are. Seriously, the results are pretty damn cool and the world kind of needs to know.

	\end{abstract}

	\begin{multicols}{2}

	\section{Introduction}
	Explain what this report is, include information on possible applications and highlight its usefulness. Write some lines explaining how most usages of this test are done in a blind fashion, with lack of understanding of the inner workings behind it.

	\section{Theoretical background}
	Add some theory on how the KS two sample test works, explain it as thoroughly as possible. 

	\section{Experimental Results}

	Create the setting by explaining which cases are under study, and why (because they are common distributions with concrete practical applications), show the results as plots, explain what is observed and why it is observed 

	\section{Final thoughts}
	
	Write a bit of text summarizing what was found with this study, explain further work (possible extension to other distributions), and possible pitfalls that were uncovered by this study.
